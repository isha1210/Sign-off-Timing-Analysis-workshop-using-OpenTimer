# Sign-off-Timing-Analysis-workshop-using-OpenTimer

About the workshop: 
Static timing analysis (STA) is a method of validating the timing performance of a design by checking all possible paths for timing violations. STA breaks a design down into timing paths, calculates the signal propagation delay along each path, and checks for violations of timing constraints inside the design and at the input/output interface.

The workshop covers all the basic concepts in STA and Timing constraints. It starts with basics of Static Timing Analysis, timing paths, startpoint, endpoint and combinational logic definitions. It explains setup and hold checks, how STA tools calculate setup and hold violations. 

It also covers design rule checks, time borrowing on latches, timing arcs, cell delays and models, impact of clock network on STA
